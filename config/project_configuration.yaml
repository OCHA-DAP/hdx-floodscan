description_90days_file: "Daily zip file containing previous 90 days of raster both SFED and SFED baseline bands."
description_stats_file: "Excel file containing date, admin metadata, raw SFED mean values (per admin 2), and equivalent approximate calculated return period."
notes: "Tabular Admin 2: \n
A daily dataset providing average FloodScan Standard Flood Extent Depiction (SFED) flood fraction (0-100%) per admin 2 
level. Historical baseline values (SFED_BASELINE) are calculated per day-of-year from the last 10 years of historical 
data (non-inclusive of current year) after applying an 11 day smoothing mean window. Return Period (RP) is calculated 
empirically based on all historical data up to the current year (non-inclusive).\n
\n

Raster Data\n
Zipped Cloud Optimized Geotifs (COGs) containing AER FloodScan estimated daily flood fraction (0-100%) gridded data at 
approximately 10 km resolution (0.083 degrees) for the last 90 days. These data are provided as an aggregated version of
 FloodScanâ€™s higher resolution data set. Each COG represents the estimates for a single day and includes 2 bands: SFED 
 (Standard Flood Event Depiction) and SFED_BASELINE. The baseline band provides users an easy way to compare current 
 values with historical averages. The baseline is calculated per day-of-year from the last 10 years of historical data 
 (non-inclusive of current year) after applying an 11 day temporal smoothing mean window."
